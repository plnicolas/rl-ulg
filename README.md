# Reinforcement learning algorithms implementation (ULi√®ge course project repository)
Project realized in the context of a reinforcement learning course, during my first year of Master in Data Science. It consisted in the implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms (Q-learning) in a discrete and in a continuous domain ("Car on the hill" problem).\
This repository only exists for archival purposes.
